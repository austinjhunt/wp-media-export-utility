# WordPress Media Export Utility

Are you migrating a WordPress site to another host? Are you struggling with a massive amount of media files? Is the full media export file to large to upload to the destination site?

Copy the content of this .js script into the console of your /wp-admin/export.php page and hit enter. Watch as it iterates over each available month of media files, and downloads one month at a time.

You can then take those individual files (assuming your month-level files are much smaller) and upload them into your destination site without dealing with size limitations that come with the full media export.
